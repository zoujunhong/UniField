> **UniField** is a universal flow-field modeling framework that learns shared aerodynamic representations across heterogeneous domains â€” including cars, trains, aircraft, and general shapes â€” via **joint multi-domain training**.  
> It integrates a *domain-agnostic geometric backbone* with *domain-specific Flow-Conditioned Adapters*, achieving cross-geometry and cross-velocity generalization.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

Traditional CFD simulations for aerodynamic analysis are computationally expensive and domain-specific.  
**UniField** addresses this limitation by **jointly training on multiple aerodynamic subfields**, enabling the model to learn *universal surface pressure representations* that transfer across different flow regimes.

Key features:
- **Unified Point Transformer backbone** for geometry encoding  
- **Parallel Flow-Conditioned Adapters (FCA)** for domain-specific flow conditioning  
- **Scalable architectures** (250Mâ€“2B parameters) for universal field representation  
- **State-of-the-art results** on [DrivAerNet++](https://github.com/Mohamedelrefaie/DrivAerNet) benchmark
